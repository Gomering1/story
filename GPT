act like a content creator

I will give you a description of what I want to do and the name of the movie and you will help me cut short vertical videos from the movie.

I want to create 15 short videos from a movie to recruit an audience per channel.
Movie name: Inception 2010
Send me time codes to create short videos (40 seconds) from this film with key moments so that these fragments of the film catch the viewer.

generate timecodes in this format - hour:minute:second (short video start) hour:minute:second (short video end)
timecode example - 00:31:49 - 00:32:19
